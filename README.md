## Chat app with rails 5
Following [this tutorial](https://www.sitepoint.com/create-a-chat-app-with-rails-5-actioncable-and-devise/) to learn about actioncable.

### For reference
- The actioncable section from rails on [github](https://github.com/rails/rails/tree/master/actioncable)
- If encounter error `ActionController::RoutingError (No route matches [POST] "/chat_rooms/1")` while following tutorial, it might be due to the part in rooms.coffee being indented inside the if statement.
- May need to add rails-jquery to gemfile.
